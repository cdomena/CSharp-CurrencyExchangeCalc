# CSharp-CurrencyExchangeCalc
Code Louisville C# Final Project. Currency exchange calculator
Based on the data from https://exchangeratesapi.io/

Basic menu will validate selection of Origin and Destination, responds accordingly.<br />
Fully functional search of available country codes in dictionary. A minimum of 3 characters for a search to run.<br />
Conversion based on EUR as base so calculation is a little more complicated but verified from external sources.<br />

By default (for now) the Origin and Destination are "N/A" to avoid null exceptions on parse attempts. So be sure to set them both before trying calculations. Just need to download and run the project.
